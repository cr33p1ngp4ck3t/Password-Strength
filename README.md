# Password Strength Checker ðŸ”‘ðŸ”’

## Overview

The **Password Strength Checker App** is designed to help users create stronger, more secure passwords. Built with Streamlit and Python, this application evaluates passwords based on various security parameters, provides real-time feedback, and can even generate strong password suggestions. In an era of increasing cyber threats, this tool is your ally in enhancing online security.

## Features

- **Password Strength Analysis:**
  - Checks if the password meets a minimum length (at least 8 characters).
  - Ensures the password includes at least one capital letter.
  - Checks for the inclusion of special characters (`.`, `!`, `@`, `#`).
  - Validates the presence of numeric values (`0-9`).
  - Prevents more than two duplicate characters for added security.
  
- **Real-Time Feedback:**
  - Provides instant and clear feedback on the strength of the entered password.

- **Strong Password Suggestions:**
  - Generates random, secure passwords based on user-defined length.

- **Modern UI:**
  - Sleek and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Why Strong Passwords Matter

With cyberattacks and data breaches on the rise, weak passwords remain a primary vulnerability. This app helps users understand what makes a password strong and empowers them to build better defenses for their online accounts. A strong password not only protects personal information but also contributes to overall digital security.
